 1. Introduction                                                *devdocs-intro*

Vim-devdocs is a very small and trivial plugin with a laser-focused purpose:
looking up keywords on `https://devdocs.io` from Vim.

It does so by providing a single command, |:DD|, that will figure out the
current filetype and point your default browser to the web app with the
correct query.

Even better, |:DD| can be used under the hood by the built-in |K| for maximum
street credibility. See |devdocs-K| below.

To work its magic, vim-devdocs depends on:

    * `xdg-open` on various Unix-like systems, part of the `xdg-utils` package,
    * `open` on MacOS, it is installed by default,
    * `cmd.exe` on WSL, it is also installed by default,
    * `explorer` on Windows, it is also installed by default,

but you can tell it to use any external command with |g:devdocs_open_command|.

Vim-devdocs started its life in my config as an experimental snippet circa
2016, then became a clean and reusable Gist in mid-2017, which I decided to
weaponize one year later. If you think a plugin should not be needed for such
a trivial feature be reassured that I totally share that view. If you feel
remix-y, the original Gist is still up in all its 13LOC glory:

    `https://gist.github.com/romainl/8d3b73428b4366f75a19be2dad2f0987`

NOTE: vim-devdocs is not affiliated in any way with `devdocs.io` so any
request pertaining to that site should be directed to its operators.

==============================================================================
 2. Installation                                         *devdocs-installation*

Method 1, use your favorite runtimepath/plugin manager.

Method 2, if you are using Vim 8.0 or above, move this directory to:
>
    # Unix-like systems
    ~/.vim/pack/{whatever name you want}/start/vim-devdocs

    # Windows
    %userprofile%\vimfiles\pack\{whatever name you want}\start\vim-devdocs
<
See |package|.

Method 3, if you are using Vim 7.4, move the files in this directory to their standard location:
>
    # Unix-like systems
    ~/.vim/doc/devdocs.txt
    ~/.vim/plugin/devdocs.vim

    # Windows
    %userprofile%\vimfiles\doc\devdocs.txt
    %userprofile%\vimfiles\plugin\devdocs.vim
<

 3. Configuration                                       *devdocs-configuration*

Options:

    g:devdocs_enable_scoping .................... |'g:devdocs_enable_scoping'|
    g:devdocs_open_command ...................... |'g:devdocs_open_command'|

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                     *g:devdocs_enable_scoping*
Value: numeric                                                               ~

Enable or disable automatic scoping.

Add the line below to your vimrc to disable this feature: >

    let g:devdocs_enable_scoping = 0
<
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                       *g:devdocs_open_command*
Value: string                                                               ~
Default: none                                                                   ~

Tell vim-devdocs what command to use to open the documentation.

Add the line below to your vimrc to tell vim-devdocs to use `my-command`: >

    let g:devdocs_open_command = "my-command"
<

 4. Usage                                                       *devdocs-usage*

                                                                          *:DD*
                                                                   *devdocs-DD*
:DD[!] [filetype] [keyword]

    1. Without [!], [filetype], or [keyword], look up the keyword under the
       cursor, scoped with the current filetype.

       For example, with the cursor on `FuncLit` in a Go buffer: >

       :DD
<
       would resolve to `https://devdocs.io/go/ast/index#FuncLit` in your
       default browser.

       With [!], don't do any automatic scoping.

    2. Without [!] or [filetype], look up [keyword], scoped with the current
       filetype.

       For example, if the active buffer is a JavaScript buffer: >

       :DD Map
<
       would resolve to `https://devdocs.io/javascript/global_objects/map` in
       your default browser.

       With [!], don't do any automatic scoping.

    3. With or without [!], look up [keyword], scoped with [filetype].

       For example, no matter what's the filetype of the current buffer: >

       :DD scss @mixin
<
       would resolve to `https://devdocs.io/sass/index#mixin` in your default
       browser.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                    *devdocs-K*
                                                           *devdocs-keywordprg*

Vim comes with the built-in and often overlooked |K|, a normal mode command
that looks up the keyword under the cursor with the external command or Ex
command set via the |'keywordprg'| option. |:DD| being a pretty basic Ex
command it is easy and strongly recommended to use it for |K|.

If you want |K| to ALWAYS use |:DD|, put this line in your vimrc: >

    set keywordprg=:DD
<
If you want |K| to use |:DD| ONLY for certain filetypes, put this line in the
appropriate `after/ftplugin/<filetype>.vim`: >

    setlocal keywordprg=:DD
<

 5. Todo                                                         *devdocs-todo*

    - Sit back and relax.

==============================================================================
 6. Done                                                         *devdocs-done*

    - All done.

==============================================================================
